# DuplicateRemoval
The purpose of this program is to remove duplicate entries in a .csv file and export the remaining
entries in a .csv file as well as output a report with the number of duplicates.

The file is supposedly a list of entities that provide the following attributes.

Current Entry attributes:
* First Name
* Last Name
* Telephone Number
* E-Mail

#V1

The Version 1 of the project will be delivered with the mobile number acting as a primary key and the
in the occurence of duplicate entries the last entry found will remain in the final list.

Report of v1 will contain:
* the number of duplicate entries found and processed
* the number of corrections/Updates made on per attribute
